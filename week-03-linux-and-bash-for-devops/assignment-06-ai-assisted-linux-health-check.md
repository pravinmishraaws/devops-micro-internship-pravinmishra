# Assignment 6 — Build an AI-Assisted Linux Health Check (AI-Assisted Linux Incident Triage)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a read-only Bash triage script that checks the health of your Ubuntu server and Nginx application, connect it to Claude Code as a reusable `/linux-triage` skill, simulate a controlled Nginx incident, use the skill to gather and analyze evidence, recover the service manually, and verify recovery. The workflow follows the Agentic Loop: Gather → Analyze → Human Act → Verify.

# Task 1 — Confirm the Healthy Baseline and Create the Workspace

## Goal

Confirm that Nginx and the React application are healthy before building the automation.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `systemctl is-active nginx`, `ss -ltn | grep ':80'`, and `curl -I http://localhost`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `pwd` and `find . -maxdepth 4 -type d | sort` showing the workspace folder structure

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What proves that Nginx is running?**

Add your answer here.

---

**2. What proves that the server is listening for HTTP traffic?**

Add your answer here.

---

**3. Why must you capture a healthy baseline before simulating an incident?**

# Task 2 — Create Project Context and Safety Rules in CLAUDE.md

## Goal

Tell Claude exactly what this project does and what it is not allowed to do.

### Evidence

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is stored in the checks array?**

Add your answer here.

---

**2. How does the `for` loop use that array?**

Add your answer here.

---

# Task 5 — Run and Understand the Healthy-State Report

## Goal

Run the Bash script against the healthy server and verify that it creates a report.

### Evidence

**4. What is the difference between a warning and a failure in this script?**

Add your answer here.

---

# Task 6 — Create and Run the /linux-triage Skill

## Goal

Turn the Bash script into a reusable, manually invoked Agentic AI workflow.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 11 — `SKILL.md` showing the frontmatter, allowed tool restrictions, and safety rules

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 12 — `/linux-triage` output for the healthy server

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. Why does this skill have Bash, Read, and Grep, but not Write?**

Add your answer here.

---

**2. Why is `disable-model-invocation: true` useful for this skill?**

Add your answer here.

---

**3. What part is performed by Bash, and what part is performed by Claude?**

Add your answer here.

---

**4. Why is this better than asking Claude "Is my server healthy?" without giving it evidence?**

Add your answer here.

---

# Task 7 — Simulate an Nginx Incident and Let the Skill Diagnose It

## Goal

Create a controlled service failure, gather evidence through Bash, and let Claude analyze the evidence without taking recovery action.
