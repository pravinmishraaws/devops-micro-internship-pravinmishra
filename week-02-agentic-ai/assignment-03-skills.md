# Assignment 3 — Building Your Command Center

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a local Claude Skills system by creating the `.claude/skills/` folder structure, adding predefined skill files, and executing a real agentic command (`/scaffold-terraform`) to generate infrastructure code. You will also observe how skills enforce tool restrictions and enable controlled automation.

# Task 1 — Create the Skill Folder Structure

## Goal

Create the required `.claude/skills/` directory structure for all skills.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/skills/` folder with all 4 subfolders visible

# Task 2 — Add the Skill Files

## Goal

Place all required skill files into their correct directories and verify their configuration.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `.claude/skills/scaffold-terraform/` open in VS Code showing both `SKILL.md` and `template-spec.md`

#### Screenshot 3 — Screenshot 3 — `tf-plan/SKILL.md` frontmatter showing `allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Grep` (no Write) and `disable-model-invocation: true`

# Task 3 — Run /scaffold-terraform

## Goal

Execute the `/scaffold-terraform` skill to generate a full Terraform infrastructure setup.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Claude's response showing the scaffold complete with the file list

# Task 4 — Run terraform init and /tf-plan

## Goal

Initialize Terraform and execute the `/tf-plan` skill to observe plan execution and output analysis.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Claude's `/tf-plan` response showing it ran the command and analyzed the result (pass or auth error both count)
