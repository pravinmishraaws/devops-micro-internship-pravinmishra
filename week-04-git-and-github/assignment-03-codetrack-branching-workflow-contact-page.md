Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will add a new Contact page to CodeTrack using a clean feature-branch workflow. You will keep each change in a separate commit, prove that your default branch remains unchanged before the merge, and validate the result after merging.

# Task 1 — Confirm Repository State and Default Branch

## Goal

Start from a clean default branch (`main` or `master`) and confirm the repository status.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `git status` and `git branch` showing a clean status and the default branch checked out

# Task 2 — Create and Switch to a Feature Branch

## Goal

Create a branch named exactly `feature/contact-page` and switch to it.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `git checkout -b feature/contact-page` and `git branch` showing `* feature/contact-page`

# Task 3 — Add contact.html on the Feature Branch

## Goal

Create `contact.html` with the provided content and commit it alone using the message `feat(contact): add Contact page`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `ls` showing `contact.html`
