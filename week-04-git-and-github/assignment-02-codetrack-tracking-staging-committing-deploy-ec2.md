# Assignment 2 — CodeTrack: Tracking, Staging, Committing + Deploy to EC2

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will track and stage project files, create two meaningful Git commits in `CodeTrack`, verify your commit history, and deploy the CodeTrack static website to an EC2 instance using Nginx. This connects local version-control practice with a basic manual deployment workflow used in real DevOps environments.

---

# Task 1 — Verify Git Setup and Enter the Repository

## Goal

Confirm that Git works and that you are inside the correct `CodeTrack` repository.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `pwd` showing you're inside `CodeTrack`

# Task 3 — Add Starter Content

## Goal

Copy the provided starter HTML and CSS content into your local `index.html` and `style.css` files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Your editor showing the contents of `index.html` and `style.css`

Files created at `/Users/ctu/Favour/CodeTrack/index.html` and `/Users/ctu/Favour/CodeTrack/style.css`.

# Task 4 — Track and Stage Files Correctly

## Goal

Confirm both files show as untracked, then stage them individually with `git add`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Output of `git status` showing both files as untracked

---

# Task 5 — Create the First Commit (Clean Initial Commit)

## Goal

Commit the staged starter files using the message `Initial UI scaffold: add index.html and style.css`, then check the log.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Output of `git commit`

![Screenshot 7](screenshots/assignment2-git-workflow.png)

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Output of `git log --oneline` showing the first commit

# Task 6 — Modify index.html and Create a Second Commit

## Goal

Follow the instruction comment inside `index.html` to update the Student Name and Group Name, then commit that change separately using the message `Update homepage content: heading, tagline, CTA button`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Browser showing the updated page with your Student Name and Group Name visible

Student Name: **Favour Ojo**, Group: **Group 3** visible in the HTML.

# Task 7 — Deploy to EC2 with Nginx (Static Website)

## Goal

Install and start Nginx on your EC2 instance, then copy `index.html` and `style.css` into the Nginx web root.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — Output of `systemctl status nginx --no-pager` showing Nginx `active (running)`

Nginx deployment to EC2 pending EC2 instance setup.

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Output of `curl -I http://localhost` showing `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

Pending EC2 instance setup.

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Browser showing the CodeTrack site loaded at `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>`, with your Full Name and Group Name visible

Pending EC2 instance setup.
